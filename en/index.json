In this sense, C/C + + and Python can be considered scientific programming languages.\nMore broadly, a scientific programming language is one that is designed and optimized to use mathematical formulas and matrices. Such languages ​ ​ are characterized not only by the presence of libraries that perform mathematical or scientific functions, but also by the syntax of the language itself. For example, neither C++ nor Python have embedded matrix types or functions for matrix arithmetic (addition, multiplication, etc.); instead, this functionality is made available through standard libraries.\nScientific programming languages should not be confused with scientific language in general, which broadly refers to the higher standards of accuracy, correctness, and compactness expected of practitioners of the scientific method.\nMembers ALGOL; APL; Fortain; J; Julia; Maple; MATLAB; Octave; R.

(the text is formatted using the Microsoft Word text editor). The font used in the illustrative material (tables and figures) is recommended to be reduced to 12 pt. The line spacing in the main text is one and a half. In the illustrative material, line spacing is recommended to be made single. Page fields must be:\nleft field - 30 mm;\nright field - 10 mm;\nupper and lower fields - 20 mm.\nEach paragraph must start with a red line. The indent of the paragraph is 12.5 mm. from the left border of the text.\nEach section of the report must start with a new page. The name of the structural elements of the report “CONTENTS,” “INTRODUCTION,” “CONCLUSION,” “REFERENCES,” “APPENDIX,” as well as section headings should be printed in capital letters and located in the middle of the line. Sections are numbered with Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3). There is no dot at the end of the headings.\nSection headings can be bold. Underlining in headings, the use of two or more types of highlighting in headings (for example, italics and bold, italics and another color other than the main text), word wrapping in chapter headings, as well as the use of non-standard characters in the text of the report, and the use of abbreviations in headings are not allowed. In the text of the report, abbreviations of terms are allowed only after the introduction of a meaningful definition of this term. All report pages (except attachments) shall be numbered starting with “Introduction,” which shall be numbered with 3. Page numbers are located in the center of the bottom of the sheet without a dot.\nIllustrative material (tables, figures, formulas) is included in the report for the purpose of clarity of argumentation and justification of the conclusions received by the student. Thus, only material that contributes to a better justification of the conclusions obtained by the student is placed in the main part of the report. Tables, reporting forms and other factual material, which is the initial data on which the study was based, are not included in the main text of the work, but can be placed in the appendix. It is recommended to include tables and figures based on the initial actual data directly in the main text of the report. All illustrative material should, where possible, be placed after the first reference to it in the text.\nIllustrations are numbered within sections. An illustration number consists of a section number and an illustration sequence number separated by a period. No dot is placed at the end. If the table is borrowed from a book or article by another author, it should be referenced at the end of the title, taking into account the requirements of these guidelines. It is not allowed to leave free cells in the table columns. If the corresponding data is not available, a dash is put in the column. Units of measurement shall be specified for digital table data. If the table data has different units, then they are indicated in the corresponding headings of the columns or rows of the table. If all table data have the same unit of measurement, then this unit, starting with the preposition “c,” is given above the table after the name separated by commas (for example, in thousand rubles, in hectares, in sq. M., in percent, etc.).\nIf necessary, you can move the table to another page. In this case, the following design option is applied. The column (or row) headings of the table are numbered, and the next page does not repeat the text of the headings, but only the corresponding column (row) number. Above the continuation of the table, the words “Continuation of Table 1.1” are printed on the top right. The table name is not repeated on the new page. It is not allowed to start the table at the bottom of the page if after the name of the table there is only a header part, or a header part plus one or two lines of content, and the main part of the table is on the next sheet. You cannot move a table to the next page if you move one or two rows of table content to the next page. In this case, you should either slightly reduce the font size used in the table so that the table fits entirely on the previous sheet; or slightly increase the spacing between the rows of the table so that the table is more evenly spaced on the pages. Pictures include pictures, diagrams, diagrams, graphs, etc. If a table or figure by volume occupies more than one page, then they must be put in the appendix to the report. The placement of the figures in the report is the same as for other illustrative material, that is, either immediately after the link to it, or on the page closest to this link. Pictures should be placed in the text so that they can be considered without turning the work. All figures shall be numbered within the sections with Arabic numerals: Figure 2.1.
